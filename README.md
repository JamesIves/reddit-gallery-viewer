## Getting Started ✈️

You can run the application locally by running `npm install` followed by `npm start`. You can then [view the application locally on port 4200](http://localhost:4200). The Reddit API does not (at the time of writing this) require any sort of client credentials, so there's no additional setup needed there.

### Tests and Linting 🧪

You can run the linting and testing scripts by running `npm run lint` and `npm run test`. You can also format the project directly using Prettier by running `npm run lint:format`.
